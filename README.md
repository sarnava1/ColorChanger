# Hactoberfest 2018 - Hall of Contributors!

![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This repo was initially created when I was learning JQuery, but now this repo will serve a noble cause! It will test the power of open-source in general and Hacktoberfest in particular.

#### Anyone seeing this:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Go to `core.js`
4. Scroll down and in the `data` variable:
  - Create a new object and add your name by creating an `name` property.
  - Add a little about yourself by creating an `about` property.
5. commit and submit a pull request!

And now you're in the open-source hall of contributors! :D
